st.write("Coho Salmon are a key part in river ecosystems due to how they transport important nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosporous, from the ocean to their spawning ground, in turn fueling the forest ecosystems and wildlife around them. Due to the sheer amount of them travelling upstream, they make an excellent food source for predators like bears, eagles, and even orcas. You can help support Coho Salmon by helping build sustainable fish ladders to help them get to spawning grounds easier, and supporting stream restoration efforts. ")
