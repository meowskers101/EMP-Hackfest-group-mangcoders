st.write("Rainbow Trout are crucial to the river ecosystem in many ways. One way is regulating other ocean invertebrates by keeping their populations in check. Another way is Rainbow Trout being one of the most farmed fish, reducing overfishing on other fish populations, therefore mutually benefiting many other fish species. You can help support Rainbow Trout by mainting trees near the banks of streams, and avoiding fishing during spawning season, which reduces the stress on the population.")
