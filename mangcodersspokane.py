st.write("Red-band Trout are a critical part of Spokane's fragile habitats. Their presence by itself signifies healthy waters, as they need very specific temperatures to thrive. They also help maintain biodiversity and reinforce food webs. Red-band Trout are unique in the fact that they serve as both predator and prey in their ecosystem. You can help support them by releasing any red-band trout you catch while fishing, and also avoiding spawning areas to help support the eggs.")
